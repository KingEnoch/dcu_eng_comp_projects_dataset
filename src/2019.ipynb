Products within near view of these hotspots will be click able to show information such as price and give the ability to add to a user’s basket.

Using EMG from the Myo armband device for ISL recognition brings improvements to communications for people with hearing and speech impairments and has more benefits than using video for ISL recognition.

Airport Assistant brings users through the process step by step, from their door to their accommodation, completing checks and providing important information along the way. The primary feature of the application is the hand luggage measurement functionality which has been developed using Augmented Reality. Users are required only to input their flight number which allows the application to scrape all relevant information. A number of Google APIs have been integrated throughout the application to direct users throughout the process. Similarly, features such as security tips and walk times to gates will help make the entire process less stressful.'},\n",

This board containing the Zynq 7020 All Programmable System on Chip contains an Arm core processor (The Process System) which recieves an overlay to configure the program logic, the fpga element of the Zynq. The logictools overlay file was modified in an atempt to allow for the driving of a 64 x 32 led matrix, and looks to call the on board pdm microphone to write values to an Axi-port. The software used for this project was Vivado High Level Synthesis for exporting c/c++ code as an RTL IP, and Vivado Hlx editions using vhdl for custom IP.'},\n",

It uses a combination of open source smart plugs, as well as proximity beacons to track a user’s movement around their home. Using machine learning it analyses a user’s daily routines and suggests ways to automate their most common behavioural patterns.'}]"
