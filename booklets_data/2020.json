Once the key points on the body have been located,\na set of mathematical heuristics such as the slope, angle and distance between points are evaluated to determine whether or not the exercise has been performed correctly. Pocket Trainer can evaluate four exercises: Bicep curl, pull up, squat and deadlift. The aim of the application is prevent injuries occurring from movements being performed incorrectly, and to improve overall exercise efficiency.",
